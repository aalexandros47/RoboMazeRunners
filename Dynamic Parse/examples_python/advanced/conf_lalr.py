"""
LALRâ€™s contextual lexer
=======================

This example showcases LALR's contextual lexer by parsing a toy configuration language where the NAME and VALUE terminals overlap. Unlike a basic lexer, which might cause parse errors by arbitrarily choosing tokens, Lark's LALR(1) algorithm correctly predicts which token to expect, ensuring a correct parse. Alternatively, the Earley algorithm can handle more cases but with a performance trade-off. See examples/conf_earley.py for details.
